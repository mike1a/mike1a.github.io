			<p> 
				As you may know by now, my name is Mike Kaplan and this is my website. 
				<br>
				<br>
				My story is pretty straightforward, and perhaps a little boring. After graduating from high school in Reston, VA I trained in audio engineering at Omega Studios in Rockville, Maryland. As part of graduating from Omega I became Pro-Tools certified, although my real interest was live sound. I moved down to Richmond in 2010 and worked at Sound of Music Studios for about a year before deciding that if I wanted to open my own studio, and to do so on my own terms, would want to do so when I had the money to buy my equipment without worrying making a return on the gear. With that in mind I enrolled at J.Sargeant Reynolds where I graduated in 2014, cum laude, with an Associates Degree in Business Administration. From there I applied, and was accepted, to Virginia Commonwealth University's Business School for Economics. I chose to go to VCU for a few reasons, but one of the biggest is that I absolutely love Richmond, VA. 
				<br>
				<br>
				My humble beginnings into Digital Marketing started in December 2013 with a sarcastic comment on reddit about 'how easy it is to do marketing for a restaurant on social media'. I guess it was a pretty decent comment, because I was contacted by an /r/rva user who was looking for someone to help with his business. I applied, interviewed, and got the job. Over the course of the next year I learned about and ran campaigns for SEO, social media management and automation, digital analytics, PPC, content marketing, copywriting, and most recently - coding. This website is my first finished project that I have ever coded. It still needs some work, but I still have plenty to learn. 
				<br>
				<br>
				When I'm not studying, working, or learning code, I spend a fair amount of time reading the news. It's a hobby I didn't expect to develop, but one that I've come to cherish. Whether it's news about business, politics, technology, or science, I see it all as being pertinent and applicable to my life. I'm also an avid Starcraft fan, a fisher, skier, and trivia fan.

					<h3>Economist-in-Training</h3>
					<p class="byline">I am currently an Economics student at the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Business, on track to graduate in May 2016. Originally an audio engineer by trade, I gave up my microphones and cables to go back to school and learn the finer workings of quantitative analysis. As time goes by, I have become increasingly happy about my decision. </p>

				<h3>Google Certified Digital Analyst</h3>
				<p class="byline">On November 21, 2014 I absent-mindedly passed the Google Analytics certification exam with an 88%.  I had studied for a few days before taking it, but had originally intended on just going through to see what the questions would be like - I really didn't expect to pass, and was shocked to find out I did on my first take.  My next focus is the Adwords Exam to become a full Google Partner.</p>

				<h3>Programmer-in-Progress</h3>
				<p class="byline">
				I never really thought that I would have an interest in how to code. I don't know why, but it never used to interest me. However, I can happily say that one of my proudest improvements in life thus far is that I made a full 180 in my way of thought. I went from willfully disinterested to writing and hosting my own website.  My next step is to focus on JavaScript, JQuery, SQL, Python, and R.

				<h3>Search Engine Optimization</h3>
				<p>
					I've always had a love for puzzles I just didn't ever think that there would be a job where I could get paid to solve them. I've been fortunate to be able to focus on cracking Google's algorithm, and I've really come to love this game. I think I've gotten pretty good at it, too. At least, according to Bill Slawski I'm an expert, for what that's worth.

				<h3>Email Marketing</h3>
				<p>
					At its core, Email Marketing is about putting words in the right order so that people will read your message and respond to your call to action. While I enjoy writing engaging messages, I am more interested in the remaining aspects of a campaign. From building a list, to measuring success, and everything in between, there is a lot that captures my attention.

				<h3>PPC Management</h3>
				<p>
					Proper PPC management is an art form that I have been working to understand more about. As mentioned, studying for the AdWords exam is on my to do list, but I have experience in keyword research, campaign reporting, and adding some extensions. I've found resources like PPC Hero and Wordstream to be of immense help to me but am always looking to learn more.

				<h3>Local Search Marketing</h3>
				<p>
					I've come to really love Local Search Marketing. It's, for me, nice to not be playing against 800 lbs gorillas and instead have a chance to optimize in lower competition environments. It's also nice knowing that on any given morning I may run into my, struggling, competition, but most importantly, it's nice to be able to give back to the community by helping local businesses increase their online visibility.

				<h3>Content & Copy Writing</h3>
				<p>
					Good copy is the difference between a lead and a sale. It's what cements our trust and guides our purchases.  Good content drives our interests, and shares our stories. Both dictate success online solely by how well a story is told, and how well it captures our collective attention. Writing brilliant copy or content isn't easy, but it's a skill that I've been trying to develop, but this is a skill that develops like a callus on a guitarists finger - out of continued use.

				<h3>Marketing Strategy</h3>
				<p>
					Getting your message heard online can be tough. It can be even tougher getting it heard by the right audience, but developing an engagement strategy to get your website in front of the right eyes has become one of my favorite things to do. Be it SEO, Social Media, or traffic leaking, there is a perfect strategy for every website - it's just a matter of finding it. What I like about Marketing is that there is no "One Size Fits All" approach, but rather, a continuous test of 'Does it work?'.
